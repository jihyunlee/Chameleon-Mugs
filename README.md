Chameleon Mugs
==============

This project is about a set of mugs that changes their colors based on their proximity to each other.

It is a very common social behavior to drink tea or coffee with family and friend around a table. What if mugs show their owners' emotional expression respectively and they also interact with each other? Aptly named Chameleon, this set of mugs represents closeness, sharing and being in sync with one another via their color changes. At the same time, each mug has its own personality with its unique color.

The <em>Chameleon Mugs</em> was presented at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2012/category/projects/" target="_blank">ITP's Winter Show 2012</a> on December 16th and 17th, 2012.
